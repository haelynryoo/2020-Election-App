Biden was a long-time member and former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He has also served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Biden led the efforts to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and the Violence Against Women Act.

Another policy is criminal justice. He says \"automatically expunging records for marijuana convictions,\" \"mandatory treatment, not jail, for those with drug addictions,\" and \"automatic restoration of voting rights\" after a sentence is served.

In 2015, Biden called for a $12 federal minimum wage, gradually increasing to $15 by 2020. He suggested a general use of private and public funds to invest in federal infrastructure, saying the U.S. needs \"a massive commitment to rebuild our infrastructure.\" Biden rolled out an ambitious climate plan in June, calling for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050",
                  Scandals: "One of Bidens biggest scandals was his plagiarism scandal in 1987. He had lifted phrases and mannerisms from a British Labour Party politician while making closing remarks at a debate. Evidence soon surfaced of Biden using material from other politicians without attribution, and he acknowledged he had been accused of plagiarism in law school. A video also emerged of Biden exaggerating his academic record while speaking angrily to a voter in New Hampshire.
